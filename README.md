# General
[edwl](https://gitlab.com/necrosis/edwl) is my fork of [dwl](https://github.com/djpohly/dwl), an easy to use wayland compositor.
I've riced it with multiple features, that I'm using very often. In this repo I'm holding a PKBUILD script for a Arch-based distros.
For more details, please visit the [gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/necrosis/edwl). Hope it will be usefull for someone!
